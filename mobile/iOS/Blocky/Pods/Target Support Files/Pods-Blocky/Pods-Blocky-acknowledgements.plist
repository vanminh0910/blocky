The license requires that you give credit to Bal&#225;zs Faludi, as the original 
author of any of our source that you use. The placement and format of the credit

software, in the software's documentation, or on the web page for the software. 
The suggested format for the attribution is:

package you made use of. When possible, please link the text "Bal&#225;zs Faludi"
