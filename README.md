## Introduction
Blocky is created to simplify the way to learn or develop IoT solution. It is an ESP8266 based Wi-Fi development board for you to create IoT applications with open-source, plug and play electronics, visual programming, remote control via cloud with both web and mobile app.The key feature of this project is that users never need to do any wiring or soldering or program one line of code when he makes an IoT solution up and running. 

Features:

* Totally open sourced for both software and hardware
* No soldering, no wiring, just plug and play with hundreds of modules (covering most IOT application domains)
* No need microcontroller programming, no programming skill needed but visual lego style programming
* Upload code over the air (OTA) via cloud
* Remote control from Internet with dashboard designed using easy drag and drop* 
* Open RESTful APIs for integration with any other system
* Lightweighted and open sourced broker server based on MQTT
* Able to deploy a private server with Docker

## About the Server

Currently we have a sandbox server for beta demo purpose only but we can't guarantee the quality of the service persists good if the amount of connections becomes large. The server can be accessed via this link http://cloud.easytech.vn
